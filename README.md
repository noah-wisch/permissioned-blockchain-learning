This repository tracks my journey into permissioned blockchains, including notes, experiments, and mini-projects using frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, and Quorum.

## Structure

- `01_notes/`: General blockchain and conceptual notes
- `02_hyperledger_fabric/`: Fabric setup, chaincode, and experiments
- `03_corda/`: Corda node demos and flows
- `04_quorum/`: Quorum examples and tests
- `05_projects/`: End-to-end mini-projects
- `resources/`: Links, PDFs, and learning material

## Goal

Understand and demonstrate practical knowledge of permissioned blockchains for real-world applications.

## Timeline

Planned study: ~3 weeks at 2â€“3 hrs/day. See Notion dashboard for details.
